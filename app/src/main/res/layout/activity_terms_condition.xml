For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.

It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Locsale app won’t work properly or at all.The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app

Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. \nThe connection can be Wi-Fi,or provided by your mobile network provider, but Locsale cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
